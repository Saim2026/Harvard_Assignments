# File IO Functionality

## File #1: Students Entries
First run the program **students_entry.py** to add new student's information. This information will be stored in **students.csv** automatically, but the records are not in order.

## File #2: Sorted Record of Students
Run the second program **sorted_std.py** to view the total entries in order. The output will be stored in a separate csv file named, **sorted_students.csv**
